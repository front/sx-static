        <p class="img-txt__desc">A static website stores a unique file for every page of a static website.
          Each time that page is requested, the same content is returned. This content is created once, during
          the design of the website. It is usually manually authored, although some sites use an automated
          creation process, similar to a dynamic website, whose results are stored long-term as completed pages.
          These automatically-created static sites became more popular around 2015, with generators such as
          Jekyll and Adobe Muse.
